# QtSimpleVotingDemoApp

The purpose of this project is for me to experiment with a the [Qt Remote Objects](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtremoteobjects-index.html) features. 

There are 3 resulting executables:

1. server - contains all the logic
2. client - QML applications users use to vote
3. management - QML application used to manage voting sessions(e.g. initiate a vote, see how each person voted, etc)
